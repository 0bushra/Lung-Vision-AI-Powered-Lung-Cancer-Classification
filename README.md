# Lung-Vision-AI-Powered-Lung-Cancer-Classification

Lung Vision is a state-of-the-art tool designed to classify histopathological lung images into three distinct categories: Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, and Lung Benign Tissue. Utilizing deep learning algorithms and a dataset of 15,000 images, this project aims to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and speed in the detection of lung cancer, leveraging technological advancements to significantly improve patient outcomes.

# Project Overview
Lung cancer remains one of the most common and lethal types of cancer worldwide. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes. Lung Vision addresses this need by providing an AI-driven tool that classifies lung tissue samples with high accuracy, aiding pathologists and medical researchers in their diagnostic processes.

# Technologies Used
Flask: Serves the backend framework to create a user-friendly web interface for uploading and classifying images.
Docker: Ensures the application is easily deployable and consistent across all platforms.
MongoDB: Manages and stores image metadata and user data, providing scalability and flexibility in data handling.
